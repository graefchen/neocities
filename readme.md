# neocities

My [neocities](https://neocities.org) [website](https://graefchen.neocities.org).

Just written with some HTML & CSS (maybe in the future even with some JS).

Also some script to help with things, it also uses [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to deploy to neocities.

## Used Libraries

The used libraries are all vendored into the `lib` folder, but are also listed below:

- [lite-youtube-embed](https://github.com/paulirish/lite-youtube-embed)

## Testing

For testing I am using the [serve](https://github.com/vercel/serve) command line
app, that is written in JavaScript, alternatively other app's could be used.

```bash
serve public
```
