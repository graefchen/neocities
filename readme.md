# neocities

My [neocities](https://neocities.org) [website](https://graefchen.neocities.org).

Just written with some HTML & CSS (maybe in the future even with some JS).

Also some script to help with things, it also uses [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to deploy to neocities.
